    <p3>Hello there! I'm Yub Raj Dhamala, a passionate and hardworking individual with a story that spans across different parts of the world. I'm thrilled to share a bit about myself with you.

My Educational Journey

My educational journey began at Trinity International College in Kathmandu, Nepal, where I completed my high school education with a focus on science and physics. The pursuit of knowledge has always been a driving force for me, and this chapter of my life laid the foundation for what was to come.<br>

Presently, I find myself in the vibrant city of Toronto, Canada, where I'm pursuing a career in computer programming at Lambton College. The decision to relocate for my studies was a significant leap, but it's been an incredible journey of growth and learning. <br>

My Roots

I hail from the beautiful region of Kailali, Nepal, and I'm proud of my roots. The values and experiences I gained growing up in Nepal have shaped my character and continue to inspire me every day.<br>

Passion and Dedication

At the youthful age of 20, I'm enthusiastic about carving my path in the world of technology. My experiences have instilled in me a strong work ethic, and I believe in putting in the effort to achieve my goals. Hard work and dedication are not just words for me; they are the principles that guide my journey.<br>

A World of Opportunities

My passion for computer programming, coupled with my diverse educational background, has opened up a world of opportunities. I'm excited to explore the limitless possibilities that the tech industry offers and to make a positive impact with my work.<br>
